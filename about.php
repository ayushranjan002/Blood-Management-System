            <h2 class="text-primary">Understanding Blood Banking</h2>
            <p> Blood banking is a critical component of the healthcare system in India, ensuring the availability of safe blood for transfusions and medical treatments. Here's an overview:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Blood Collection:</strong> Blood is collected from voluntary donors through blood donation drives organized by hospitals, blood banks, and non-profit organizations.</li>
                <li><strong>Blood Testing:</strong> Donated blood undergoes rigorous testing for blood type, infectious diseases such as HIV, hepatitis, and syphilis, ensuring its safety for transfusion.</li>
                <li><strong>Blood Storage:</strong> Once tested, blood components like red blood cells, platelets, and plasma are separated and stored under controlled conditions to maintain their integrity.</li>
                <li><strong>Blood Distribution:</strong> Blood banks distribute blood and blood products to hospitals and healthcare facilities as per demand, ensuring timely access to safe blood for patients.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="text-primary">Role of Blood Banks in India</h2>
            <p>In India, blood banks play a crucial role in meeting the blood requirements of a diverse population. Some key points about blood banking in India include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Challenges:</strong> Despite efforts to increase voluntary blood donation, India faces challenges such as blood shortages, inadequate infrastructure, and ensuring the quality of donated blood.</li>
                <li><strong>Government Initiatives:</strong> The Government of India has implemented various initiatives like the National Blood Policy and National Blood Transfusion Council to regulate and promote safe blood donation and transfusion practices.</li>
                <li><strong>Voluntary Blood Donation:</strong> Promoting voluntary blood donation is essential to ensure an adequate and safe blood supply. Organizations like the Indian Red Cross Society and NGOs work towards raising awareness and organizing blood donation camps.</li>
